### 08/08/2025
Task(s) Completed:

Downloaded and loaded FEVER and Indian Fake News datasets.

Merged them with existing datasets (LIAR, WeLFAKE, etc.).

Fixed missing column issues by combining title and text where applicable.

Verified merged dataset integrity (no missing text or label).

Final merged dataset shape: 221,220 rows ‚Üí REAL: 136,105, FAKE: 85,115.

Challenges Faced:

Initial merge caused large data loss due to "nan" placeholder replacements.

Solved by properly combining title and text before replacing placeholders.

Next Steps:

Begin EDA & TF-IDF baseline model tomorrow.
